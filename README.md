# Syntax & Coffee

This repository contains the custom WordPress development for **Syntax & Coffee**, a blog and portfolio site that blends front‑end development, design, and personal projects.

## Project Overview
Syntax & Coffee is a developer‑focused site built on WordPress but extended through custom themes, code, and GitHub version control. The project demonstrates how to go beyond default WordPress themes and create a personalized, professional site.

## What's Inside
- **Custom Theme Development**: A theme crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, tailored to give the site a unique look and feel.
- **WordPress Integration**: Content managed through the WordPress block editor while keeping the freedom to inject custom scripts and styles.
- **Version Control**: The entire `wp-content` directory (themes, plugins, and other customizations) is tracked here with Git and GitHub.
- **Learning Journal**: A place to experiment with advanced WordPress techniques as part of coursework and personal growth.

## Goals
- Build a professional‑quality website to showcase projects and writing.
- Practice customizing WordPress beyond off‑the‑shelf themes.
- Demonstrate ability to integrate WordPress with modern developer workflows (GitHub, VS Code, SFTP).

## How to Use
Clone the repository and place the `wp-content` folder into a WordPress installation to run the theme and customizations locally or on a server.
